      "[Regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions) (or regex) are a powerful tool for working with text.\n",
      "Regex show up all over the place: at the command line with tools like [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) and in many programming languages, especially scripting languages. \n",
      "Here we'll be demonstrating the use of regex in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python is pretty good for working with strings even without regex. \n",
      "See for example all of the [string methods](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) available. \n",
      "With Python strings you can do text search and replace in much the same way you do in a word processor.\n",
      "For example, you can search for the string 'spma' in a larger string and replace it with 'spam' using the [replace](http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace) method.\n",
      "This is limited to searching for literal strings, though. \n",
      "Sometimes you want to search for a *pattern*, for example a date in the format '##/##/####' where you don't know the actual values.\n",
      "That's where regex can help."
